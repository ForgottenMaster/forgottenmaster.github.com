      <description>Before working gradually through Vulkan, we will assume we want to implement a reusable wrapper library for Vulkan, since Ash itself is very unsafe, and we don&amp;rsquo;t really want to write unsafe code everywhere. We can have a proper separation of library and executable packages and allow for their own dependencies by using Cargo workspaces.
Root At the root of the package will be a Cargo.toml file describing the workspace. The way Cargo handles workspaces is that at this workspace level we simply need to name the members of the workspace.</description>

      <description>In order to follow along with the course, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to get the project up and running, and nail down the tech stack we&amp;rsquo;ll be using.
The Stack  The language - Rust The Vulkan crate - ash The windowing crate - winit The window abstraction crate - raw-window-handle The glue crate - ash-window  Install Rust If the Rust toolchain is already installed, we can skip this bit. Luckily Rust is easy enough to install.</description>
