  "articleBody": "Creating a repository There are two different ways to establish a repository in Git in contrast to other version control systems where there is only creating the initial repository.\nIn Git we are also able to clone a repository to create copy containing all of the objects and history from an existing repository.\nInitialising a new repository This is how we can create a brand new Git repository which may either be empty, or contain data/files already.\nIn order to initialise a new repository we simply use the init subcommand while inside the root folder we want to turn into a repository. For example if we want to make a brand new one.\nmkdir repo\rcd repo\rgit init\rOf course, the repo folder need not be empty, and the steps would be the same to initialise an existing folder as a repository.\nCloning an existing repository Git is also able to easily make a clone of an existing repository which will copy all of the objects and history across with it, but allows branching and commits to this new repository independant of the source one.\nIn open source development, this is the most common way, as a developer will make a clone of the central repository in order to make their own fixes that they can then request to be merged back into the central/online repository.\nIn order to clone a repository we can do\ngit clone  repo\rWhere path-to-repository can either be a relative or absolute path to another local repository on the machine or something more exotic such as a URL.\nThe most popular way to clone is using the GitHub URL to the repository.\nAdding and removing files In order to add and remove files to the repository, one can use the add and rm subcommands, along with a set of files to add or remove.\nWhen a file is added or removed however, it is not immediately added to the repository, or removed from the repository but only staged as a change to make to the repository.\nIn order to add a file that is either currently untracked by the repository, or has been edited and needs updating in the repository, we can do the following\ngit add file_to_add.txt\rAnd we can remove a file that is currently tracked by the repository also\ngit rm file_to_remove.txt\rThis will add or remove the file from the staged change as mentioned previously\nViewing staged changes We can use the subcommand status to display the list of files that have been staged to be added or modified, the list of files staged for removal, and the list of files that Git has found in the folder that aren’t tracked yet.\nThis last type is the state that a file will be in when you first create it and add it to the folder (or a subfolder), but before it’s been staged for addition with the add subcommand.\nFor example, after the following sequence of commands where we add a file, and then remove a file:\ngit add file_to_add.txt\rgit rm file_to_remove.txt\rWe will see the following when we ask for the status:\ngit status\rOn branch master\rChanges to be committed:\r(use \"git restore --staged ...\" to unstage)\rnew file: file_to_add.txt\rdeleted: file_to_remove.txt\rUntracked files:\r(use \"git add ...\" to include in what will be committed)\runtracked_file.txt\rCommitting staged changes Once we’ve added and removed files to the stage, and we are ready for the repository to be updated to reflect the changes, we will need to perform a commit operation.\nWhen we commit to the repository, we are required to give a message identifying the changes that were made.\nWe can either do this by specifying it on the command line to the commit subcommand as follows:\ngit commit -m \"Committing some changes\"\rOr, for more detailed messages, they can be composed in a text editor. To do this, just use the commit command without specifying the message:\ngit commit\rWhich will then open the default text editor where you can type a more detailed message, save, and exit - the commit will then be applied.\nOnce staged changes are committed, using the status subcommand again will show that the stage is upto date with the repository, this state is referred to as clean.\nConfiguration The subcommand config can be used to specify various parameters affecting the operation of Git. Before you can make a commit, Git needs to know your name and email address as a minimum.\nThese can be set as such:\ngit config user.name \"Name Here\"\rgit config user.email \"myemailaddress@example.com\"\rViewing commits The log subcommand will allow us to see the history of commits done to the repository. They will be displayed from most recent to the oldest, since Git always keeps the head of the commit chain and accesses the others from there.\nEach entry will show the commit hash, along with the author name/email, the date of the commit, and the message.\nFor example after doing two commits to a repository, we may see something like the following on the command line:\ngit log\rcommit 2f988a4223baa3d8bd1db16f8cc777181eb390cd (HEAD - master)\rAuthor: Robin Firth \rDate: Sat Nov 6 19:34:57 2021 +0000\rChanged the text from \"Some text\" to \"Changed text\"\rcommit 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a\rAuthor: Robin Firth \rDate: Sat Nov 6 19:33:55 2021 +0000\rInitial commit\rAn individual commit can be viewed with the show subcommand. This is useful if you are given a commit hash in conversation with someone and you want to see what was changed in that commit.\nFor example, to see the initial commit above we can use show and see the following:\ngit show 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a\rcommit 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a\rAuthor: Robin Firth \rDate: Sat Nov 6 19:33:55 2021 +0000\rInitial commit\rdiff --git a/file_to_add.txt b/file_to_add.txt\rnew file mode 100644\rindex 0000000..9dbfeee\r--- /dev/null\r+++ b/file_to_add.txt\r@@ -0,0 +1 @@\r+Some text\r\\ No newline at end of file\rThis shows the same information as in the log, however also shows the file differences that were part of that commit.\nDiffing commits If you have any 2 commit hashes, you can easily determine the diff that is applied to the first commit, in order to reach the second commit.\nFor example, in order to see the diff that was applied between the initial commit, and the second commit above, we will use the command and see something like:\ngit diff 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a 2f988a4223baa3d8bd1db16f8cc777181eb390cd\rdiff --git a/file_to_add.txt b/file_to_add.txt\rindex 9dbfeee..41c4a21 100644\r--- a/file_to_add.txt\r+++ b/file_to_add.txt\r@@ -1 +1 @@\r-Some text\r\\ No newline at end of file\r+Changed text\r\\ No newline at end of file\rAnd we can see fromm the diff that “Some text” was removed, and “Changed text” was added in its place.\nRenaming files We could achieve the same result as a rename by removing the file, renaming it, and adding it back again, however there is a Git command for renaming or moving a file. For example if we want to rename file_to_add.txt to renamed_file.txt, we can do so as follows:\ngit mv file_to_add.txt renamed_file.txt\rA move can be achieved by keeping the destination filename the same, but specifying the folder that it should be placed under.\nAfter the above rename, running git status shows:\nOn branch master\rChanges to be committed:\r(use \"git restore --staged ...\" to unstage)\rrenamed: file_to_add.txt - renamed_file.txt\rAdvanced configuration There are actually 3 levels of configuration for the Git config subcommand\n Repository-specific. These are the default level if you use the config subcommand without specifying one of the others. These will take precedence if set and override any system or user level configuration settings. User-specific. These are next lowest in the hierarchy and if not overridden will be applied for all repositories for that user only. These are set by using the –global option. System-wide. These are the lowest priority and if not overridden will apply to all repositories, of all users on that system. This is specified with the –system option.  Example: setting name For an example, we’ll show setting the user.name configuration setting we showed before, at the 3 levels of configuration.\n Repository-specific  git config user.name \"User Name For This Repo Only\"\rUser-specific  git config --global user.name \"User Name For All Repositories For This User\"\rSystem-wide  git config --system user.name \"User Name For Everybody\"\rViewing configuration settings We can view all the set configuration settings by passing the “-l” flag to the config subcommand. Which will display something like the following:\ngit config -l\rdiff.astextplain.textconv=astextplain\rfilter.lfs.clean=git-lfs clean -- %f\rfilter.lfs.smudge=git-lfs smudge -- %f\rfilter.lfs.process=git-lfs filter-process\rfilter.lfs.required=true\rhttp.sslbackend=openssl\rhttp.sslcainfo=C:/Program Files/Git/mingw64/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt\rcore.autocrlf=true\rcore.fscache=true\rcore.symlinks=false\rcore.editor=\"C:\\\\Program Files\\\\Microsoft VS Code\\\\bin\\\\code.cmd\" --wait\rpull.rebase=false\rcredential.helper=manager-core\rcredential.https://dev.azure.com.usehttppath=true\rinit.defaultbranch=master\ruser.email=theforgottenmaster@googlemail.com\ruser.name=Robin Firth\rcore.repositoryformatversion=0\rcore.filemode=false\rcore.bare=false\rcore.logallrefupdates=true\rcore.symlinks=false\rcore.ignorecase=true\rUnsetting a configuration setting The –unset flag can be passed to unset a specific configuration setting at any of the three levels (by omitting, or including either –global or –system flags). For unsetting the user.name setting for example at all levels, we could do:\ngit config --unset user.name\rgit config --unset --global user.name\rgit config --unset --system user.name\rAliases You can set your own aliases for more complex commands in Git. This allows you to run complex commands with a shorter subcommand.\nFor example we can make an alias which will commit with a default message, and run it:\ngit config alias.default-commit -- \"commit -m 'Default commit message'\"\rgit default-commit\r",

  <div class="post-content"><h3 id="creating-a-repository">Creating a repository<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#creating-a-repository">#</a></h3>
<p>There are two different ways to establish a repository in Git in contrast to other version control systems where there is only creating the initial repository.</p>
<p>In Git we are also able to clone a repository to create copy containing all of the objects and history from an existing repository.</p>
<h4 id="initialising-a-new-repository">Initialising a new repository<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#initialising-a-new-repository">#</a></h4>
<p>This is how we can create a brand new Git repository which may either be empty, or contain data/files already.</p>
<p>In order to initialise a new repository we simply use the init subcommand while inside the root folder we want to turn into a repository. For example if we want to make a brand new one.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>mkdir repo
cd repo
git init
</code></pre><p>Of course, the repo folder need not be empty, and the steps would be the same to initialise an existing folder as a repository.</p>
<h4 id="cloning-an-existing-repository">Cloning an existing repository<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#cloning-an-existing-repository">#</a></h4>
<p>Git is also able to easily make a clone of an existing repository which will copy all of the objects and history across with it, but allows branching and commits to this new repository independant of the source one.</p>
<p>In open source development, this is the most common way, as a developer will make a clone of the central repository in order to make their own fixes that they can then request to be merged back into the central/online repository.</p>
<p>In order to clone a repository we can do</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git clone &lt;path-to-repository&gt; repo
</code></pre><p>Where path-to-repository can either be a relative or absolute path to another local repository on the machine or something more exotic such as a URL.</p>
<p>The most popular way to clone is using the GitHub URL to the repository.</p>
<h3 id="adding-and-removing-files">Adding and removing files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#adding-and-removing-files">#</a></h3>
<p>In order to add and remove files to the repository, one can use the add and rm subcommands, along with a set of files to add or remove.</p>
<p>When a file is added or removed however, it is not immediately added to the repository, or removed from the repository but only <em>staged</em> as a change to make to the repository.</p>
<p>In order to add a file that is either currently untracked by the repository, or has been edited and needs updating in the repository, we can do the following</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git add file_to_add.txt
</code></pre><p>And we can remove a file that is currently tracked by the repository also</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git rm file_to_remove.txt
</code></pre><p>This will add or remove the file from the staged change as mentioned previously</p>
<h3 id="viewing-staged-changes">Viewing staged changes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#viewing-staged-changes">#</a></h3>
<p>We can use the subcommand <strong>status</strong> to display the list of files that have been staged to be added or modified, the list of files staged for removal, and the list of files that Git has found in the folder that aren&rsquo;t tracked yet.</p>
<p>This last type is the state that a file will be in when you first create it and add it to the folder (or a subfolder), but before it&rsquo;s been staged for addition with the add subcommand.</p>
<p>For example, after the following sequence of commands where we add a file, and then remove a file:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git add file_to_add.txt
git rm file_to_remove.txt
</code></pre><p>We will see the following when we ask for the status:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        new file:   file_to_add.txt
        deleted:    file_to_remove.txt

Untracked files:
  (use &quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to include in what will be committed)
        untracked_file.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="committing-staged-changes">Committing staged changes<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#committing-staged-changes">#</a></h3>
<p>Once we&rsquo;ve added and removed files to the stage, and we are ready for the repository to be updated to reflect the changes, we will need to perform a <em>commit</em> operation.</p>
<p>When we commit to the repository, we are required to give a message identifying the changes that were made.</p>
<p>We can either do this by specifying it on the command line to the commit subcommand as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git commit -m &quot;Committing some changes&quot;
</code></pre><p>Or, for more detailed messages, they can be composed in a text editor. To do this, just use the commit command without specifying the message:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git commit
</code></pre><p>Which will then open the default text editor where you can type a more detailed message, save, and exit - the commit will then be applied.</p>
<p>Once staged changes are committed, using the status subcommand again will show that the stage is upto date with the repository, this state is referred to as <em>clean</em>.</p>
<h3 id="configuration">Configuration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#configuration">#</a></h3>
<p>The subcommand <em>config</em> can be used to specify various parameters affecting the operation of Git. Before you can make a commit, Git needs to know your name and email address as a minimum.</p>
<p>These can be set as such:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config user.name &quot;Name Here&quot;
git config user.email &quot;myemailaddress@example.com&quot;
</code></pre><h3 id="viewing-commits">Viewing commits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#viewing-commits">#</a></h3>
<p>The <em>log</em> subcommand will allow us to see the history of commits done to the repository. They will be displayed from most recent to the oldest, since Git always keeps the head of the commit chain and accesses the others from there.</p>
<p>Each entry will show the commit hash, along with the author name/email, the date of the commit, and the message.</p>
<p>For example after doing two commits to a repository, we may see something like the following on the command line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git log
commit 2f988a4223baa3d8bd1db16f8cc777181eb390cd (HEAD -&gt; master)

Author: Robin Firth &lt;theforgottenmaster@googlemail.com&gt;
Date:   Sat Nov 6 19:33:55 2021 +0000

    Initial commit
</code></pre><p>An individual commit can be viewed with the <em>show</em> subcommand. This is useful if you are given a commit hash in conversation with someone and you want to see what was changed in that commit.</p>
<p>For example, to see the initial commit above we can use show and see the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git show 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a

</code></pre><p>This shows the same information as in the log, however also shows the file differences that were part of that commit.</p>
<h3 id="diffing-commits">Diffing commits<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#diffing-commits">#</a></h3>
<p>If you have any 2 commit hashes, you can easily determine the diff that is applied to the first commit, in order to reach the second commit.</p>
<p>For example, in order to see the diff that was applied between the initial commit, and the second commit above, we will use the command and see something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git diff 18dd164cf53fdb05bb757d3e0b452c4bfcf0b38a 2f988a4223baa3d8bd1db16f8cc777181eb390cd

+++ b/file_to_add.txt
@@ -1 +1 @@
-Some text
\ No newline at end of file
+Changed text
\ No newline at end of file
</code></pre><p>And we can see fromm the diff that &ldquo;Some text&rdquo; was removed, and &ldquo;Changed text&rdquo; was added in its place.</p>
<h3 id="renaming-files">Renaming files<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#renaming-files">#</a></h3>
<p>We could achieve the same result as a rename by removing the file, renaming it, and adding it back again, however there is a Git command for renaming or moving a file. For example if we want to rename file_to_add.txt to renamed_file.txt, we can do so as follows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git mv file_to_add.txt renamed_file.txt
</code></pre><p>A move can be achieved by keeping the destination filename the same, but specifying the folder that it should be placed under.</p>
<p>After the above rename, running git status shows:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use &quot;git restore --staged &lt;file&gt;...&quot; to unstage)
        renamed:    file_to_add.txt -&gt; renamed_file.txt
</code></pre><h3 id="advanced-configuration">Advanced configuration<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#advanced-configuration">#</a></h3>
<p>There are actually 3 levels of configuration for the Git config subcommand</p>
<ol>
<li>Repository-specific. These are the default level if you use the config subcommand without specifying one of the others. These will take precedence if set and override any system or user level configuration settings.</li>
<li>User-specific. These are next lowest in the hierarchy and if not overridden will be applied for all repositories for that user only. These are set by using the &ndash;global option.</li>
<li>System-wide. These are the lowest priority and if not overridden will apply to all repositories, of all users on that system. This is specified with the &ndash;system option.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="example-setting-name">Example: setting name<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#example-setting-name">#</a></h4>
<p>For an example, we&rsquo;ll show setting the <strong>user.name</strong> configuration setting we showed before, at the 3 levels of configuration.</p>
<ol>
<li>Repository-specific</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config user.name &quot;User Name For This Repo Only&quot;
</code></pre><ol start="2">
<li>User-specific</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config --global user.name &quot;User Name For All Repositories For This User&quot;
</code></pre><ol start="3">
<li>System-wide</li>
</ol>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config --system user.name &quot;User Name For Everybody&quot;
</code></pre><h4 id="viewing-configuration-settings">Viewing configuration settings<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#viewing-configuration-settings">#</a></h4>
<p>We can view all the set configuration settings by passing the &ldquo;-l&rdquo; flag to the config subcommand. Which will display something like the following:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config -l
diff.astextplain.textconv=astextplain
filter.lfs.clean=git-lfs clean -- %f
filter.lfs.smudge=git-lfs smudge -- %f

core.ignorecase=true
</code></pre><h4 id="unsetting-a-configuration-setting">Unsetting a configuration setting<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#unsetting-a-configuration-setting">#</a></h4>
<p>The <em>&ndash;unset</em> flag can be passed to unset a specific configuration setting at any of the three levels (by omitting, or including either &ndash;global or &ndash;system flags). For unsetting the user.name setting for example at all levels, we could do:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config --unset user.name
git config --unset --global user.name
git config --unset --system user.name
</code></pre><h3 id="aliases">Aliases<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aliases">#</a></h3>
<p>You can set your own aliases for more complex commands in Git. This allows you to run complex commands with a shorter subcommand.</p>
<p>For example we can make an alias which will commit with a default message, and run it:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>git config alias.default-commit -- &quot;commit -m 'Default commit message'&quot;
git default-commit
</code></pre>
