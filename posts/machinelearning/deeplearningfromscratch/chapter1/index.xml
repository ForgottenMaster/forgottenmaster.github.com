      <description>There isn&amp;rsquo;t too much to say for what a function actually is, since being a programmer, we use them every day. However for completeness I&amp;rsquo;ll include a post here.
For our purposes it will help to think of a function as a black box, that takes one or more inputs and returns an output. We can then chain these functions together by taking the output of function 1, and passing it to the next function and so on.</description>

      <description>Maths The derivative of a function is the rate at which the output changes with respect to a change in the input at a specific value for the input. This last part is important as the derivative of a function is essentially the gradient, or tangent of the graph of that function at a specific point which can of course change depending on where you are on the number line.</description>

      <title>Chain Rule</title>

      <description>The chain rule allows us to determine the derivative of a composite function as a product of the derivatives of each of the individual functions.
The reason this is a product is because, say you had a function &amp;ldquo;f&amp;rdquo; which has a derivative of 3 at a particular value of x. That means, when you increase the input by 1, the output increases by 3.
Then say you have a second function &amp;ldquo;g&amp;rdquo; which has a derivative of 5 at the value output by &amp;ldquo;f&amp;rdquo; for x.</description>
