      <description>Although we have managed to put together a working neural network library that allows us to build various topologies of networks and to train them to fit a non-specified mathematical function that is represented by the input data and targets, the initial implementation is only somewhat successful. We can do better in a few ways, we will explore 5 such extensions to the basic approach in the following notes.
High level review We can imagine a neural network at a high level as a black box which consists of a bunch of weights internally (grouped into layers, but we can consider this as an implementation detail), taking a bunch of input data records and producing a bunch of predictions for those records.</description>
