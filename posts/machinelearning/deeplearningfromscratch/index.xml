      <description>After running through the book and getting a fully working feed-forward deep learning API and learning the inner workings of neural networks as a result, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided not to pursue this particular book any further.
The purpose of reading this particular book was to enable me to get a better understanding into what makes neural networks tick, and as a result it was necessary to write this series of posts with diagrams, maths, and code.</description>
