      <description>With the standard feed-forward architecture we used in the chapters until this point, we are able to input a collection of observations, with each observation having a number of features. In the case of the MNIST recognition network, these features were the greyscale pixel values.
However, such a &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; model has no knowledge or concept of &amp;ldquo;closeness&amp;rdquo; of features to one another. This means that the learned features in a hidden layer, derived as some linear combination of the input pixel data could draw from pixels that are nowhere near each other in the input.</description>
