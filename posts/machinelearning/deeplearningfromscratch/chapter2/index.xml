      <description>Overview Supervised learning is a branch of machine learning that can be described as finding patterns or relationships in data that has already been measured. The &amp;ldquo;supervised&amp;rdquo; part of the phrase comes from the fact that we need to monitor the output that the system gives for a given input and to tell the system how close or far away it is from the measured result.
As a short example, suppose we looked at 100 houses and measured both their square footage and market value.</description>
