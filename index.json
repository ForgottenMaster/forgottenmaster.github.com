I will continue to be a point of contact and driving force for improvements in this position.\nUbisoft Reflections\nPrincipal Gameplay Programmer - Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed VR\nAugust 2023 - October 2023\nI became a principal gameplay programmer during the closing period of this project, which meant that I did not notice any change of responsibilities from a senior position, since I would be bug fixing in either position. I had already taken ownership of several systems as a senior and continued to own, polish, and improve those systems.\nUbisoft Reflections\nSenior Gameplay Programmer - Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed VR\nApril 2020 - August 2023\nAs a senior gameplay programmer I have been responsible for architecting and implementing large systems in Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed VR. Where the product statement isn\u0026rsquo;t clear or is incomplete, I have worked with other disciplines to ensure the final design does what is required. During this time I have gained experience in Unity3D including DOTS and best practices for efficient programs. Additionally, I attempt to always share my knowledge as I develop it myself so as to allow others to also build their skills. My main epiphany or learning from this project has been the now popular \u0026ldquo;Entity Component System\u0026rdquo; (ECS) architecture which I have put into practice in a large feature of the project.\nUbisoft Reflections\nGameplay Programmer - Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s The Division 2\nMarch 2018 - April 2020\nAs a gameplay programmer I have helped design and implement some fairly large systems for \u0026ldquo;Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s The Division 2\u0026rdquo; with the main feature being clans. As part of the clans feature I worked with designers, as well as the online team in order to develop clan missions and rewards, and clan spaces.\nUbisoft Reflections\nJunior Gameplay Programmer - Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s The Division\nNovember 2014 - March 2018\nIn this position I worked on \u0026ldquo;Tom Clancy\u0026rsquo;s The Division\u0026rdquo; as well as the associated expansion packs and DLC. I gained industry experience using C++ in a large codebase, and also with the in-house engine used to develop these (Snowdrop). I gained experience in using visual scripting and node graph systems.\nEutechnyx Ltd.\nProgrammer - Auto Club Revolution\nJuly 2010 - November 2014\nWhile working at Eutechnyx I was part of the team developing \u0026ldquo;Auto Club Revolution\u0026rdquo;, a social network and gaming site revolving around car enthusiasts. I gained experience with front and back end web technologies using HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend, and Python for the backend. Additional technologies used were MongoDB for the database management software, along with Redis for caching. Being a dynamic website, I gained experience interfacing with popular APIs including Facebook, and payment providers.\nNewcastle University\nMSc, Computer Games Engineering\n2008-2009\nDissertation titled \u0026ldquo;Games with a purpose\u0026rdquo;\nGraduated with merit\nNewcastle University\nBSc, Computing Science\n2005-2008\nDissertation titled \u0026ldquo;Video records of everyday life\u0026rdquo;\nGraduated with first class degree\n","permalink":"https://forgottenmaster.github.io/resume/","summary":"Ubisoft Reflections\nPrincipal Gameplay Programmer - Unannounced Title\nNovember 2023 - Present\nAfter moving from Assassin\u0026rsquo;s Creed Nexus VR to an unannounced title, I continue my responsibilities as a principal gameplay programmer by learning the existing frameworks and features, collaborating with others to improve them, and add new functionality required by design (which I then take ownership of).
