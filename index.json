However for completeness I\u0026rsquo;ll include a post here.\nFor our purposes it will help to think of a function as a black box, that takes one or more inputs and returns an output. We can then chain these functions together by taking the output of function 1, and passing it to the next function and so on.\nThe advantage of thinking of them as a chain like this rather than a stack as programmers are used to thinking of them, is that this chain will easily map to the concept of the forward pass of a neural network later on.\nAssuming the existence of two functions f and g which take a single argument and return a value, running through these functions will look as follows\nlet f = |x: f64| x * x; let g = |x: f64| x + 10.0; let input = 42.0; // input into the first function in the chain let intermediate = f(input); // after invoking function \u0026#34;f\u0026#34;, the output is an intermediate result let output = g(intermediate); // to get the final input, we can pass this intermediate result through \u0026#34;g\u0026#34;  ","permalink":"https://forgottenmaster.github.io/posts/machinelearning/deeplearningfromscratch/chapter1/functions/","summary":"There isn\u0026rsquo;t too much to say for what a function actually is, since being a programmer, we use them every day.
