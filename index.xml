      <description>I originally had my posts directly on the website, however now have converted them into an Obsidian vault which has better searching, linking, etc.
In order to access my notes, please clone my Obsidian Vault.
These are simply markdown files so can be browsed in any supported viewer, however for best results, please use Obsidian.</description>
