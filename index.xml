      <description>I originally had my posts directly on the website, however now have converted them into an Obsidian vault which has better searching, linking, etc.
In order to access my notes, please clone my Obsidian Vault.
These are simply markdown files so can be browsed in any supported viewer, however for best results, please use Obsidian.</description>

Principal Gameplay Programmer - Unannounced Title
November 2023 - Present
After moving from Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed Nexus VR to an unannounced title, I continue my responsibilities as a principal gameplay programmer by learning the existing frameworks and features, collaborating with others to improve them, and add new functionality required by design (which I then take ownership of). I will continue to be a point of contact and driving force for improvements in this position.</description>
