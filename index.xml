      <description>Ubisoft Reflections
Senior Gameplay Programmer
April 2020 - Present
As a senior gameplay programmer I have been responsible for architecting and implementing large systems in Assassin&amp;rsquo;s Creed VR. Where the product statement isn&amp;rsquo;t clear or is incomplete, I have worked with other disciplines to ensure the final design does what is required. During this time I have gained experience in Unity3D including DOTS and best practices for efficient programs. Additionally, I attempt to always share my knowledge as I develop it myself so as to allow others to also build their skills.</description>
